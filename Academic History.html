		<p> I attended Ellsworth High School in Maine. There I was a top student in my class. I was active and involved in many activities. I played basketball all four years, ran track two years, and cross country for one year. I was the vice President of my class all four years and was in student council during those four years as well. I was also apart of national honors society.</p>
